# SpaceStation Odyssey

*A zero-g time management sim*

Here on humanity’s most advanced space station, the impact of everything you do is multiplied by hundreds compared to on Earth. Working out makes you that much stronger, studying makes you that much smarter, and each discovery made here improves the lives of that many more people. But, time is going by much faster, so 5 years will have passed on earth by the time you return. What you choose to fit in to your 42 hour stay is up to you. Just remember, you still need to take care of yourself while you’re up here.
